This is the introduction document for the provided task.

"Engineer a federated data fusion framework to harmonize EHR 
and real-time biosensor streams into a unified digital twin repository."

To implement this, we are going to simulate the actual sensor readings from wearables,
store the recorded vitals in the temporal format along with the EHR details of the patient.

The stored vitals and the real-time recorded wearable data is leveraged to assess the health
conditions like heart-disease, stress alerts and hypertension alerts of the patients.

The system acts as a federated unit of Machine Learning Models, Sensor data and the database.

Technology stack used is 
Firebase -> for harmonizing EHR details with real-time sensor data 
Decision Tree and Random Forest Models -> To carry out risk assessment in real-time.
Streamlit Interface -> for making the federated system usable and managable for new and existing 
patients.
